### Meshes
The included meshes and textures were made by talented researchers and artists.

**Original Stanford Dragon**

This is the origin of the dragon model and the bunny. Credit to Stanford University for creating
the bunny and dragon models from scans in 1993 and 1996, respectively.

**Updated Stanford Dragon**

Morgan McGuire reconstructed a model in 2011 from a rescan graciously provided by Georgia Tech. It contains more triangles than the original model.

**Baked Stanford Dragon**

Prefix Studios in 2022 adapted the reconstructed Stanford Dragon by Morgan McGuire to be PBR baked with an accompanying texture and normal mapping. It is a very nice looking model and is the primary mesh used in this project.
The model is licensed under CC 4.0 and I converted it to wavefront via Blender.
